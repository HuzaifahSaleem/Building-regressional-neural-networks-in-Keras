# Building-regressional-neural-networks-in-Keras

This code pattern describes how you can build a neural network using keras for solving regression problems and what factors to keep in mind when trying to achieve maximum accuracy. 
This code contains 4 parts where different architecture and training settings are used and then evaluated them for getting the most optimal neural network.
